<h2>REST API Methods and Notes:</h2>
<div class="doc">
This web application features two database tables:<br />

<h3>Table PARTS:</h3>
	name (text): Name of the part.<br />
	type (text): Type of the part.<br />
	modelnum (text): Model Number of the part.<br />
	filename (text): Name of the .png file that holds a picture of the part
		in the IMAGES table.<br />
		
<h3>Table IMAGES:</h3>
	filename (text): Name of the .png file uploaded to the database.<br />
	file (bytea): Byte array which stores the image file.<br /><br />
	
The following section will refer to the URL base path as (BASE_PATH).<br />
This can be either http://locahost:8080/timsproject or https://timsproject.herokuapp.com
depending on where the app is running. API GET calls return JSON.<br />
